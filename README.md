## 🎯*Problem Statement*
In today’s fast-paced world, stress, anxiety, and mental health issues are on the rise. Many people struggle to find time for self-care practices like meditation, breathing exercises, and mood tracking. While there are apps and tools available, they often lack personalization and interactivity. A *chatbot* that can guide users through these practices in a conversational and engaging way can bridge this gap.
